      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-container">
        <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Abanob Hany" class="profile-pic"/>
        <p>Every alert tells a story â€” and I have built my career on uncovering it. From the first suspicious log entry to the final incident report, I specialize in turning raw data into actionable security intelligence. Working in the SOC field, I have tracked threats in real time, contained incidents under pressure, and safeguarded critical systems against evolving attacks. My mission is simple: see the threat before it sees you.</p>
